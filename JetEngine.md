# JetEngine


|Name|Type|Description|
|--|--|--|
|`afterburnerThrottleStart`|`float`|This is the throttle at which the afterburner will kick in.|
|`bypassRatio`|`float`|The amount of air that bypasses the core. This can greatly increase fuel efficiency. All the cool engineers are doing it these days.|
|`compressionRatio`|`float`|Increasing compression can increase fuel efficiency (and thrust up to a point), but also increases the length and weight of the core.|
|`hasAfterburner`|`bool`|It greatly increases the power of the engine but it decreases efficiency.|
|`hasReverseThrust`|`bool`|Allows the engine to push air forward to slow down the craft.|
|`mass`|`float`||
|`price`|`int`||
|`shroudCurvature`|`float`|The amount of curvature the shroud should use. Only usable with a non-zero bypass ratio. This is cosmetic only and does not affect performance.|
|`shroudLength`|`float`|The length of the shroud. This is cosmetic only and does not affect performance.|
|`size`|`float`|Changes the overall size of the jet engine.|
