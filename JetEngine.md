# JetEngine


|Name|Type|Description|
|--|--|--|
|`afterburnerThrottleStart`|`float`|This is the throttle at which the afterburner will kick in.|
|`bypassRatio`|`float`|The amount of air that bypasses the core. This can greatly increase fuel efficiency. All the cool engineers are doing it these days.|
|`compressionRatio`|`float`|Increasing compression can increase fuel efficiency (and thrust up to a point), but also increases the length and weight of the core.|
|`designerPerformanceAltitude`|`float`|Designer only. |
|`designerPerformanceHeader`|`string`|Designer only. |
|`designerPerformanceIsp`|`string`|Designer only. Specific impulse, which represents how fuel efficient the engine is.|
|`designerPerformanceMach`|`float`|Designer only. Speed of the craft as a fraction of the speed of sound.|
|`designerPerformanceMaxThrust`|`string`|Designer only. The thrust of the engine at this altitude and speed.|
|`hasAfterburner`|`bool`||
|`shroudCurvature`|`float`|The amount of curvature the shroud should use. Only usable with a non-zero bypass ratio. This is cosmetic only and does not affect performance.|
|`shroudLength`|`float`|The length of the shroud. This is cosmetic only and does not affect performance.|
|`size`|`float`|Changes the overall size of the jet engine.|
