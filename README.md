# SR2 XML Guide
This guide is under construction. Patience.

The big difference between SP and SR2 modding is that you can add new modifiers to things as you like. For instance, a landing leg might not have an `InputBasedActivator` on it by default, but you can just add one.

If you find, or think you have found, any inaccuracies or omissions, do not be afraid to ask, or submit a PR.
